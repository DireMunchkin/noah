# Barkd Forwarding Invoices TODO

## Goal

Let the Noah server create Lightning invoices for users without waking their devices. Noah will
read the user's Ark address from Postgres and ask a server-side Bark wallet to create a BOLT11
invoice whose claimed VTXO is forwarded directly to that address.

The forwarding wallet must never become the source of truth for Noah users. Postgres continues to
own user identity and Ark addresses; barkd owns only its wallet keys, SQLite state, and the durable
actions needed to claim and deliver Lightning receives.

Only Noah connects to Postgres. Barkd does not need Postgres credentials; it needs its volume plus
outbound access to the configured Ark server and chain source.

## Locked Decisions

- [x] Run barkd as a separate Fly app, not inside the replicated Noah server process.
- [x] Run exactly one barkd Machine per network with one attached Fly Volume.
- [x] Keep the existing Noah server stateless and retain its blue/green deployment strategy.
- [x] Reach barkd over Fly's private 6PN network and require barkd bearer authentication.
- [x] Do not allocate public IPs or expose barkd's REST API or Swagger UI publicly.
- [x] Use barkd's `POST /api/v1/lightning/receives/invoice/for-address` endpoint.
- [x] Roll out on signet before creating the mainnet wallet.
- [x] Keep the push-notification invoice flow available as a feature-flagged fallback.
- [x] On rollback, stop creating new barkd invoices but leave barkd running so paid, parked actions
  can finish delivery.
- [x] Accept that the initial single-volume design has restart/deploy and volume-host downtime; it
  is durable but not highly available.

This plan was last checked against barkd `0.6.1` and the linked documentation on 2026-08-17.
Pin the deployed version; do not build from a moving branch or use an unpinned `latest` image.

## Target Architecture

```text
Lightning payer
      |
      | LNURL callback
      v
Noah server (one or more blue/green Machines)
      |
      | 1. Read the user's Ark address from Postgres
      | 2. Authenticated HTTP over Fly 6PN
      v
barkd (one always-on Machine in iad)
      |
      | SQLite database, mnemonic, auth token
      v
Fly Volume mounted at /data
      |
      | Paid receive is claimed directly to the user's address
      v
User's Ark mailbox
```

Use separate apps and wallets for each network:

| Network | Proposed Fly app | Noah caller | Datadir |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Signet | `noah-barkd-signet` | `noah-signet` | `/data` |
| Mainnet | `noah-barkd-mainnet` | `noah-mainnet` | `/data` |

## Phase 0: Resolve Protocol and Product Gates

These items block implementation or mainnet rollout.

### Lightning receive anti-DoS

- [x] The target Ark servers do not enforce `ln_receive_anti_dos_required`; no receive token or
  proof VTXO is required for this rollout.
- [x] Keep the Noah client aligned with barkd's current `for-address` request: `address`,
  `amount_sat`, and `description`.

### Amount and fee semantics

- [ ] Decide how Noah handles LNURL amounts that are not whole satoshis. LNURL supplies
  millisatoshis while barkd accepts an integer `amount_sat`.
- [ ] Recommended first behavior: require `amount_msat % 1000 == 0`, reject any fractional-sat
  request, and use a checked conversion to `u64` satoshis. Never silently round.
- [ ] Confirm that the BOLT11 amount exactly equals the LNURL callback amount.
- [ ] Confirm and document the amount the recipient receives after the Ark server's configured
  Lightning receive fee.
- [ ] Verify minimum and maximum amounts after fees, not only Noah's existing LNURL limits.

### Address compatibility

- [ ] Confirm stored user addresses contain a server-mailbox delivery mechanism.
- [ ] Confirm signet addresses are rejected by mainnet barkd and vice versa.
- [ ] Confirm addresses for a different Ark server are rejected.
- [ ] Continue taking the address only from the authenticated Noah user record; never accept a
  forwarding address directly from the public LNURL callback request.

## Phase 1: Package Barkd

### Container image

- [ ] Add `fly/barkd.Dockerfile`.
- [ ] Pin an explicit barkd release version.
- [ ] Download the matching Linux release binary or compile the tagged source.
- [ ] Verify the release checksum during the image build.
- [ ] Include only the runtime files required by barkd and health/debug tooling that operators
  intentionally need.
- [ ] Run `barkd --version` in CI and assert the pinned version.
- [ ] Decide how the mounted volume gets ownership and permissions before dropping privileges.
- [ ] Ensure the mnemonic, SQLite database, and auth-token file are readable only by the barkd
  runtime user.
- [ ] Do not enable `--expose-mnemonic` in the normal container command.
- [ ] Do not use `BARKD_NO_AUTH`.

The normal process should be equivalent to:

```sh
barkd --datadir /data --host :: --port 3000
```

`barkd` currently parses `--host` as an IP address, so use the IPv6 wildcard `::`; do not pass the
Fly hostname `fly-local-6pn` as the flag value.

### CI and releases

- [ ] Add a workflow or documented manual command for building and publishing the pinned image.
- [ ] Keep barkd image deployment separate from the Noah server image deployment.
- [ ] Require a tested database backup before every barkd version upgrade.
- [ ] Read upstream release notes for database migrations and downgrade compatibility.
- [ ] Do not assume rolling back the binary is safe after the new binary has migrated SQLite.

## Phase 2: Add Fly Apps and Volumes

### Configuration files

- [ ] Add `fly/signet.barkd.fly.toml`.
- [ ] Add `fly/mainnet.barkd.fly.toml` only after signet passes the rollout gates.
- [ ] Use `iad`, matching the Noah server's primary region.
- [ ] Mount a volume named `bark_data` at `/data`.
- [ ] Configure `BARKD_DATADIR=/data`, `BARKD_BIND_HOST=::`, and `BARKD_BIND_PORT=3000`.
- [ ] Use `strategy = "rolling"`; Fly blue/green and canary deployments are not supported for
  Machines with attached volumes.
- [ ] Keep one Machine running with auto-stop disabled.
- [ ] Add a top-level TCP check on port 3000. Do not put a bearer token in `fly.toml` merely to make
  an HTTP health check work.
- [ ] Do not add `[http_service]`, `[[services]]`, or public IPs. Noah can connect directly over 6PN.

Expected configuration shape:

```toml
app = "noah-barkd-signet"
primary_region = "iad"

[build]
  dockerfile = "barkd.Dockerfile"

[deploy]
  strategy = "rolling"

[env]
  BARKD_DATADIR = "/data"
  BARKD_BIND_HOST = "::"
  BARKD_BIND_PORT = "3000"

[[mounts]]
  source = "bark_data"
  destination = "/data"
  snapshot_retention = 30

[checks.barkd_tcp]
  type = "tcp"
  port = 3000
  interval = "30s"
  timeout = "5s"
  grace_period = "15s"

[[vm]]
  memory = "512mb"
  cpu_kind = "shared"
  cpus = 1
```

Validate the VM size under concurrent signet invoice creation before copying it to mainnet.

### One-time Fly provisioning

- [ ] Create the signet app in the same Fly organization as `noah-signet`.
- [ ] Create one `bark_data` volume in `iad` and choose its size explicitly.
- [ ] Deploy exactly one Machine.
- [ ] Verify `fly volumes list` shows the volume attached to that Machine.
- [ ] Verify `fly machine list` shows only one barkd Machine.
- [ ] Verify `fly ips list` shows no public IPs. Release any public IP allocated accidentally.
- [ ] From a Noah Machine, resolve `noah-barkd-signet.internal` and connect to port 3000.
- [ ] Confirm the API is unreachable from the public internet.

Illustrative commands; verify them against the installed `flyctl` before execution:

```sh
fly apps create noah-barkd-signet
fly volumes create bark_data --app noah-barkd-signet --region iad --size 1
fly deploy --config fly/signet.barkd.fly.toml --remote-only --ha=false
fly scale count 1 --app noah-barkd-signet
fly ips list --app noah-barkd-signet
```

## Phase 3: Initialize and Snapshot Each Wallet

### Wallet initialization

- [ ] Start barkd with the empty mounted datadir. It should generate its REST auth token.
- [ ] Retrieve the bearer token in a controlled operator session with
  `barkd --datadir /data secret show`.
- [ ] Store the token as `BARKD_AUTH_TOKEN` on the corresponding Noah app.
- [ ] Store `BARKD_URL=http://noah-barkd-signet.internal:3000` on `noah-signet`.
- [ ] Do not store the bearer token in Git, logs, Docker layers, or `fly.toml`.
- [ ] Reach barkd through an operator tunnel or private Machine and call
  `POST /api/v1/wallet/create` exactly once.
- [ ] Use the documented Second signet endpoints:
  - Ark server: `https://ark.signet.2nd.dev`
  - Esplora: `https://esplora.signet.2nd.dev`
- [ ] Record the returned wallet fingerprint and compare it after every restore.
- [ ] Retrieve the generated mnemonic in a controlled session and store it in the approved offline
  secret-management/recovery system.
- [ ] Ensure the normal deployment is restarted without mnemonic exposure enabled.
- [ ] Repeat the process independently for mainnet; never reuse the signet mnemonic or datadir.

Current documented mainnet connection details are:

- Ark server: `https://ark.second.tech`
- Esplora: `https://mempool.second.tech/api`
- Network value: `mainnet`

Reconfirm these endpoints in Second's documentation at the time of mainnet initialization.

### Fly Volume snapshots

The initial backup policy intentionally uses Fly Volume snapshots only. Fly takes automatic daily
snapshots and supports retention from 1 to 60 days. This accepts up to roughly one day of database
state loss after a volume-host failure; the mnemonic remains the recovery backstop for wallet
balance, while recent payment history and in-progress action state may be missing.

- [ ] Set `snapshot_retention = 30` on the barkd mount and confirm automatic snapshots are enabled.
- [ ] Store the mnemonic outside Fly in the approved offline recovery system; do not rely on the
  volume snapshot as the only copy of it.
- [ ] After provisioning, list snapshots and confirm a snapshot reaches the `created` state.
- [ ] Create an on-demand snapshot before every barkd upgrade or risky operational change.
- [ ] Record the volume ID in the operator runbook so snapshots remain discoverable after deletion.
- [ ] Perform a full restore rehearsal on signet:
  - Stop the original Machine.
  - List snapshots with `fly volumes snapshots list <volume-id>`.
  - Restore the selected snapshot into a fresh volume of equal or greater size.
  - Start exactly one replacement Machine.
  - Confirm the fingerprint, pending actions, and receive history.
  - Pay a new invoice and verify delivery.
- [ ] Write the mainnet disaster-recovery runbook before enabling mainnet traffic.

Continuous off-Machine backups with `bark-backupd` or another tool are a future hardening option,
not an initial rollout requirement.

## Phase 4: Add a Small Noah Barkd Client

### Configuration

- [ ] Add the following server configuration:
  - `BARKD_FORWARDED_INVOICES_ENABLED`, default `false`
  - `BARKD_URL`, required only when enabled
  - `BARKD_AUTH_TOKEN`, required only when enabled and always redacted
  - `BARKD_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, with a conservative default
- [ ] Fail server startup when the feature is enabled but URL or token is missing.
- [ ] Validate that the production URL is HTTP on an approved `.internal` hostname; private 6PN
  traffic already travels through Fly's encrypted WireGuard network.
- [ ] Never log the authorization header, mnemonic, preimage, or full response bodies from errors.

### Client module

- [ ] Add `server/src/barkd_client.rs` with a narrow internal interface such as:

```rust
#[async_trait]
trait ForwardingInvoiceProvider {
    async fn create_invoice_for_address(
        &self,
        address: &str,
        amount_sat: u64,
        description: Option<&str>,
    ) -> anyhow::Result<ForwardingInvoice>;

    async fn receive_status(&self, identifier: &str)
        -> anyhow::Result<ForwardingReceiveStatus>;
}
```

- [ ] Implement the interface with the existing `reqwest` dependency.
- [ ] Use `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on every request.
- [ ] Model barkd error bodies without including secrets in returned `ApiError` messages.
- [ ] Set connect and total-request timeouts.
- [ ] Do not add automatic retries around invoice-creation POSTs. The endpoint has no idempotency
  key, so a timed-out request may already have created an invoice.
- [ ] Allow status GETs to retry with bounded backoff.
- [ ] Store the client in `AppStruct` as an optional dependency controlled by the feature flag.
- [ ] Add a startup/degraded-readiness probe using authenticated `GET /api/v1/wallet/ark-info`, but
  do not make temporary barkd unavailability remove every Noah web Machine from service.

### Tests for the client

- [ ] Test the request path, JSON body, bearer header, and response parsing against a local stub.
- [ ] Test `400`, `401`, `404`, `500`, malformed JSON, connect failure, and timeout behavior.
- [ ] Test that errors and tracing fields do not contain the bearer token.
- [ ] Test that invoice creation is attempted once when the response times out.

## Phase 5: Integrate the LNURL Route

The current fallback branch begins in `server/src/routes/public_api_v0.rs` after direct Ark
negotiation fails.

- [ ] Preserve the current direct-Ark negotiation path unchanged.
- [ ] After direct negotiation fails, use barkd when all of the following are true:
  - The feature flag is enabled.
  - The active user has a stored Ark address.
  - The LNURL amount converts exactly to whole satoshis.
- [ ] Snapshot the user's current Ark address into the forwarding request; a later profile update
  must not change the destination of an already-issued invoice.
- [ ] Build a non-sensitive invoice description consistent with the existing LNURL metadata.
- [ ] Call `create_invoice_for_address` and return the resulting BOLT11 invoice in `pr`.
- [ ] Keep `routes` empty and decide whether the existing `ark` response field should contain the
  user's address on this fallback response.
- [ ] Preserve the existing device push flow when barkd is disabled, the user has no Ark address,
  or the configured fallback policy allows it after a barkd error.
- [ ] Do not require an Expo push token merely to take the barkd path.
- [ ] Decide separately whether Noah's mailbox authorization remains a product-policy requirement.
  Barkd validates mailbox delivery in the Ark address, but Noah's authorization may still be needed
  for Noah's mailbox worker to notify the device about the delivered VTXO.
- [ ] Define the failure policy explicitly:
  - Recommended: make one barkd attempt with no POST retry.
  - If no invoice is returned, use the old push path when the user is eligible.
  - Otherwise return a normal LNURL error without exposing barkd internals.
- [ ] Rate-limit the barkd path at least as strictly as the existing LNURL callback.
- [ ] Add structured events for outcome, latency, amount, and error class. Do not log tokens,
  mnemonics, preimages, or raw signed Ark data.

### Durable audit and reconciliation

- [ ] Add a Postgres migration for a small forwarding-invoice audit table.
- [ ] Store at least:
  - Noah request ID
  - user pubkey or stable user ID
  - Lightning address
  - Ark address snapshot
  - amount in millisatoshis and satoshis
  - BOLT11 invoice or parsed payment hash
  - latest barkd state
  - creation, last-check, preimage-revealed, delivery, and settlement timestamps
- [ ] Keep Bark SQLite authoritative for Bark action recovery; the Postgres row is for Noah audit,
  reconciliation, and alerts, not for reconstructing Bark actions.
- [ ] Add a bounded reconciliation worker that calls
  `GET /api/v1/lightning/receives/{identifier}` for non-terminal rows.
- [ ] Use the existing Postgres worker-claim pattern so multiple Noah Machines do not poll the same
  row concurrently.
- [ ] Map and persist barkd states: `awaiting-payment`, `htlcs-ready`, `preimage-revealed`,
  `delivering`, and `settled`.
- [ ] Parse and store the payment hash, but deliberately ignore and never persist or log the
  `payment_preimage` returned by the status API.
- [ ] Alert on paid receives stuck in `preimage-revealed` or `delivering` beyond an agreed threshold.
- [ ] Define retention for unpaid/expired invoices and settled audit rows.

## Phase 6: Test End to End on Signet

### Functional tests

- [ ] Create a signet invoice through Noah for a test user's stored Ark address.
- [ ] Verify the invoice amount and payment hash.
- [ ] Pay it from an independent wallet.
- [ ] Observe the receive progress to `settled` through barkd's status endpoint.
- [ ] Sync the destination Noah wallet and verify it discovers and can spend the forwarded VTXO.
- [ ] Confirm the forwarding barkd wallet cannot spend the delivered user output.
- [ ] Confirm the forwarding wallet does not accumulate the user's received balance.
- [ ] Repeat with concurrent payments to different users and to the same user.

### Failure and recovery tests

- [ ] Stop barkd before invoice creation and verify the configured push/error fallback.
- [ ] Restart barkd with an unpaid invoice and confirm it remains queryable.
- [ ] Interrupt barkd after payment while the action is parked or delivering; confirm restart resumes
  the action and reaches `settled`.
- [ ] Temporarily make the destination mailbox unavailable, then restore it and verify delivery
  resumes.
- [ ] Exercise an invalid address, wrong-network address, wrong-server address, and an address
  without supported mailbox delivery.
- [ ] Exercise a non-whole-satoshi LNURL amount.
- [ ] Exercise barkd `401`, timeout, and malformed-response paths.
- [ ] Restore the wallet onto a new volume and verify a pending delivery can resume.
- [ ] Verify a Noah deploy or restart does not interrupt barkd.
- [ ] Verify a barkd rolling deploy has expected downtime but preserves the datadir.

### Load and abuse tests

- [ ] Establish a safe per-user/IP rate limit for invoice creation.
- [ ] Load-test expected concurrent invoice creation and status polling on the proposed VM size.
- [ ] Measure SQLite growth from unpaid invoices and determine cleanup/retention behavior.
- [ ] Confirm repeated client retries cannot redirect an invoice away from the address stored in
  Postgres.

## Phase 7: Observability and Operations

- [ ] Add metrics or structured events for:
  - invoice creation attempts, successes, and failures
  - barkd request latency and timeouts
  - current receives by lifecycle state
  - age of the oldest `preimage-revealed` and `delivering` receive
  - last successful authenticated Ark server check
- [ ] Verify automatic snapshots regularly and before/after barkd upgrades.
- [ ] Alert when barkd is unreachable, unauthorized, disconnected from the Ark server, or has a
  stuck paid receive.
- [ ] Alert when the Fly volume is near capacity.
- [ ] Document bearer-token rotation:
  - Rotate with `barkd --datadir /data secret refresh` in a controlled session.
  - Update the corresponding Noah Fly secret.
  - Restart/roll Noah and verify authentication.
- [ ] Document volume-host failure and restoration from continuous backup.
- [ ] Document barkd upgrades, database backup, verification, and rollback constraints.
- [ ] Add a dashboard/runbook link to every alert.

## Phase 8: Rollout

- [ ] Merge the infrastructure and client code with
  `BARKD_FORWARDED_INVOICES_ENABLED=false` everywhere.
- [ ] Deploy and initialize `noah-barkd-signet`.
- [ ] Complete the signet functional, crash-recovery, and snapshot-restore tests.
- [ ] Enable signet for internal accounts, then a small cohort, then all signet users.
- [ ] Observe at least one full invoice lifecycle and one barkd restart before mainnet approval.
- [ ] Create the mainnet app, volume, wallet, token, and snapshot policy independently.
- [ ] Verify the mainnet fingerprint and store the mainnet mnemonic using the recovery procedure.
- [ ] Recheck mainnet Ark server fees, limits, and mailbox key.
- [ ] Enable mainnet for internal accounts and low payment limits first.
- [ ] Expand gradually while monitoring stuck states, fallback rate, and recipient discovery.

### Rollback

- [ ] Set `BARKD_FORWARDED_INVOICES_ENABLED=false` to send new requests through the existing flow.
- [ ] Do not stop or delete barkd during an application rollback.
- [ ] Continue reconciling every invoice already returned to a payer until it settles or reaches a
  documented terminal recovery state.
- [ ] Preserve the Fly Volume, mnemonic, bearer token, and backups even if the feature remains
  disabled.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Barkd is reachable from Noah over private 6PN and unreachable publicly.
- [ ] Exactly one barkd Machine owns exactly one attached volume per network.
- [ ] Noah remains blue/green deployable without a volume.
- [ ] The bearer token and mnemonic never appear in source control or logs.
- [ ] A stored user Ark address can receive a paid Lightning invoice without waking the device.
- [ ] The destination wallet discovers and spends the forwarded VTXO after syncing.
- [ ] Barkd cannot redirect or spend an output created for the stored destination address.
- [ ] A barkd restart resumes a paid parked delivery.
- [ ] Fly snapshot creation and restore have been tested successfully.
- [ ] Stuck paid receives produce actionable alerts.
- [ ] Disabling the feature restores the old invoice flow without abandoning existing barkd
  actions.

## Future Option: Postgres-Backed Bark Worker

Do not include this in the initial rollout. If the single-volume operational model becomes a real
constraint, evaluate a dedicated service built with `bark-wallet`, a Postgres `StorageAdaptor`, and
a distributed `LockManager`/leader lease. It must remain separate from the replicated Noah HTTP
process and pass Bark's persistence differential tests plus Noah crash/failover tests before it can
replace barkd.
